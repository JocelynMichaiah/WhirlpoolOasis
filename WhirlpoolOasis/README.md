 The contracts are located at /contracts
 The front end website is located at /front_end

 The purpose of the contract is to helps users regain their privacy. Whenever a user makes
    a transaction on the blockchain, the info of from, to, and how much is stored on the explorer
    and visible for everyone to see. This means that anyone can tell if you interacted with 'x' contract
    or recieved 'y' funds from someone. By using this service, you can obfuscate this info by transfering
    all your funds to the contract tied to a new address. Wait for other users to interact with the contract (preferably 1-2 weeks),
    then withdraw to your new address, with no connection between your new address and old one.

This is possible by using structured deposits and withdrawals. A very simple example is if you have 3
    people: Alice, Bob, and John. Suppose Alice, Bob, and John all deposit 10 ROSE into the contract. Then
    a day later, some new person 'Anon' comes along and withdraws 10 ROSE from the contract. From an outsider perspective,
    one can assume that Anon is either Alice, Bob, or John, but they don't know which one exactly. Now imagine this example with 100 people,
    and you can see how privacy is restored for the users, by removing all ties their old address might have had with their new one.
